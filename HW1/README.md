HW1:

In this homework I began to experiment with time-series techniques, particulary a trend analysis. 

Here I used the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset to analyze job satisfaction over time. The process looked relatively stationary which is common with real data. 

I also ran a regression to measure time and job satisfaction to determine if there was any relationship, and there did not appear to be any relationship at the 5% or 10% significance level.

This conclusion aligns with my earlier point about stationarity. 

I also plotted a sinusoidal line of best fit to see the trend more clearly, in the data snapshot it does appear that a sinusoidal relationship exists. 

But I would be more cautious about making this conclusion without the bigger picture (literally). 

I regressed variables like satisfaction with finances and did find that financial satisfaction may contribute to job satisfaction.
