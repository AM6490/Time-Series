HW2:

In this assignment I experimented with fixed effects models using data from the quality of governance (QOG) dataset. 

The first relationship that I examine is whether birth rates impact female unemployment rate. I found that although there is a positive relationship between the two variables, the relationship was not significant at the 5% level. 

I also compared the fixed effects model to a standard OLS, and it proved to have better explanatory power, which was likely due to its ability to account for time-invariant factors unlike the OLS.

I also checked if GDP had any impact on the relationship between female unemployment and birth rates, and it did not (at least at a significant level)

I then tried using a random effects model, which was not very strong in its explanatory power.
